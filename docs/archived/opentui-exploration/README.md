# OpenTui Exploration Archive

**Date Completed:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Archived - Reference Only  
**Decision:** Not chosen for v1 (see IMPLEMENTATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

- **IMPLEMENTATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md** - Decision rationale and roadmap
- **COMPLETE_REPORT.md** - Executive summary
- **INDEX.md** - Navigation guide with reading paths

## Key Decision

After thorough evaluation, we chose **@inquirer/prompts** for v1 because:

- **OpenTui is alpha software** (v0.1.30)
- **Not production-ready** - breaking changes likely
- **Limited documentation** - sparse examples, incomplete API docs
- **Small community** - limited support and examples
- **Complex lifecycle** - high risk of terminal state corruption

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Risk | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| Alpha Status | üî¥ High | Breaking changes disrupts release |
| Documentation | üî¥ High | Difficult to debug and extend |
| Community | üü° Medium | Limited support resources |
| Maturity | üî¥ High | No production track record |
| Complexity | üî¥ High | More surface area for bugs |

## What We Learned

### OpenTui Strengths ‚úÖ
- Full terminal control (Yoga layout engine)
- Imperative component API
- Event-driven (EventEmitter)
- Highly customizable styling
- Real-time interaction feedback

### OpenTui Challenges ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Each prompt needs its own renderer instance
- Complex lifecycle management (async setup, manual cleanup)
- Terminal state can be corrupted on errors
- Event listener cleanup is manual and error-prone
- Renderer overhead adds latency

### Integration Patterns ‚úÖ
We successfully demonstrated:
- Wrapping imperative APIs in Effect.promise()
- Event listener patterns for interactive components
- Sequential prompt composition with Effect.gen
- Lifecycle management (setup ‚Üí run ‚Üí cleanup)
- Error propagation through Effect chains

## For Future Reference

### If You Need to Revisit OpenTui (v2+ Advanced Features)

**Step 1:** Read the decision documents
```
1. IMPLEMENTATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md  - Why we decided what we did
2. EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md             - Technical findings
```

**Step 2:** Understand the patterns
```
3. PATTERNS_VISUAL_GUIDE.md           - How to integrate OpenTui with Effect
```

**Step 3:** Study the API
```
4. OPENTUI_EXPLORATION.md             - Complete API reference
```

**Step 4:** Review the code
```
Original code examples (in git history):
- poc-select.ts   - SelectRenderable integration
- poc-input.ts    - InputRenderable integration
- poc-combined.ts - Multi-prompt workflow
```

### Check OpenTui Status

Before reconsidering OpenTui, check:
1. Version - Is it v1.0.0+ now?
2. Documentation - Is it comprehensive?
3. Community - Is there active maintenance?
4. Breaking Changes - Any API stability?

Only proceed if:
- ‚úÖ OpenTui is v1.0.0+
- ‚úÖ Production-ready claim
- ‚úÖ Good documentation
- ‚úÖ Active community

---

## Code Examples (Preserved in Git)

The original POC code demonstrated these patterns:

### Pattern 1: Simple Wrapper
```typescript
function selectPrompt<T>(
  options,
  title
): Effect.Effect<T, Error> {
  return Effect.promise(() =>
    new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      const renderer = await createCliRenderer()
      const select = new SelectRenderable(renderer, { options, ... })
      renderer.root.add(select)
      select.on('itemSelected', () => {
        const value = select.getSelectedOption()?.value
        renderer.stop()
        resolve(value)
      })
      renderer.start()
    })
  )
}
```

### Pattern 2: Sequential Composition
```typescript
const workflow = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const framework = yield* _(selectPrompt(frameworks))
  const name = yield* _(inputPrompt('Name:'))
  const version = yield* _(inputPrompt('Version:'))
  
  return { framework, name, version }
})
```

These patterns are generic and applicable to any imperative TUI library.

## Next Phase: Ink Exploration

We are now evaluating **Ink** as the primary TUI framework because:

**Ink Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Production-proven (Claude, Copilot, GitHub CLI, etc.)
- ‚úÖ React-based component model
- ‚úÖ Excellent TypeScript support
- ‚úÖ Rich UI capabilities
- ‚úÖ Active maintenance
- ‚úÖ Large community

**Ink vs OpenTui:**

| Aspect | OpenTui | Ink |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Status | Alpha (0.1.30) | Production (v4+) |
| Component Model | Imperative | React (Declarative) |
| Learning Curve | High | Medium (React knowledge) |
| Production Ready | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Community | Small | Large |
| Documentation | Sparse | Excellent |

See: `docs/` for Ink exploration POC (coming next)
