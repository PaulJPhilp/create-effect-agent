    "effect-cli-tui": "^0.5.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Directory Move**

## Remaining Steps (Manual)

### 1. **Create GitHub Repository**
- Navigate to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `effect-cli-tui`
- Description: "Effect-native CLI wrapper with interactive prompts and Ink components for terminal UIs"
- Make it **public**
- Initialize without README (we have one)
- Create repository

### 2. **Push effect-cli-tui to GitHub**
```bash
cd /Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/effect-cli-tui
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. **Create Release v0.5.0**
- Go to: https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/effect-cli-tui/releases
- Click **"Create a new release"**
- Tag: `v0.5.0`
- Title: `Initial Release: effect-cli-tui v0.5.0`
- Description: (See release notes below)
- Publish release

**GitHub Actions will automatically:**
- Run tests
- Build distribution
- Publish to npm registry (v0.5.0)

### 4. **Verify npm Publication**
```bash
npm view effect-cli-tui@0.5.0
```

Expected response: Package details showing version 0.5.0

### 5. **Final Monorepo Update** (After npm publish)
Update dependency to use npm package:
```bash
cd /Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/create-effect-agent
# Update pnpm-workspace.yaml to only include 'packages/create-effect-agent'
# Update package.json to use "effect-cli-tui": "^0.5.0"
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm exec vitest run
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: consume effect-cli-tui from npm registry"
git push
```

## Directory Structure

**Before Spin-Off:**
```
create-effect-agent/
├── packages/
│   ├── create-effect-agent/
│   └── effect-cli-tui/          ← Was here
└── ...
```

**After Spin-Off:**
```
In-Progress/
├── create-effect-agent/
│   ├── packages/
│   │   └── create-effect-agent/
│   └── ...
└── effect-cli-tui/              ← Now here

## Testing Commands

**Local Testing (Before npm publish):**
```bash
# Build
pnpm build

# Test (using vitest, not pnpm test)
pnpm exec vitest run

# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Format
pnpm format
```

**Standalone Testing (effect-cli-tui):**
```bash
cd /Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/effect-cli-tui
pnpm exec vitest run
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Current State:**
- effect-cli-tui is decoupled and ready for standalone npm publication
- create-effect-agent still uses workspace reference (will auto-resolve locally)
- Tests: All 14 tests passing ✅
- Builds: All successful ✅

✅ **What's Working:**
- Git repository initialized and ready to push
- All source code available locally
- CI/CD workflows configured (publish.yml, test.yml)
- Package.json with correct npm metadata
- Version: 0.5.0

⏳ **What's Pending:**
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Create GitHub Release v0.5.0
4. Publish to npm
5. Update create-effect-agent to consume from npm
6. Final integration verification

## Success Criteria

- [x] effect-cli-tui has independent git repository
- [x] All files moved to /Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/effect-cli-tui
- [x] create-effect-agent workspace decoupled
- [x] All tests passing (14/14)
- [x] Build successful
- [ ] GitHub repository created (manual)
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub (manual)
- [ ] Published to npm (manual)
- [ ] create-effect-agent updated to use npm package (manual)

---

## Rollback Instructions

If anything fails, the current local setup allows easy rollback:

```bash
# To restore to monorepo structure temporarily:
cd /Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/create-effect-agent
git revert 771e44d
```

The effect-cli-tui git repository is preserved in `/Users/paul/Projects/In-Progress/effect-cli-tui/` and can be used independently.

**Ready for Phase 2: GitHub publication and npm deployment** 🚀
